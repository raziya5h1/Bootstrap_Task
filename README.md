  - Navbar
  - Hero Carousel
  - Features section (cards)
  - Subscribe Modal
  - Footer

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (custom `style.css`)  
- **Bootstrap 5** (via CDN)  
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and hosting)  
- **Formspree** (for functional contact & subscribe forms)

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Process
1. **Setup**: Created folder structure with `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `style.css`.  
2. **Bootstrap Integration**: Added Bootstrap 5 via CDN.  
3. **Components Used**:
   - Navbar
   - Carousel (Hero)
   - Cards (Features/About)
   - Modal (Subscribe)
   - Forms (Contact + Subscribe)
   - Footer  
4. **Styling**: Added `style.css` for hover effects, shadows, and polish.  
5. **Responsiveness**: Tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop using Bootstrap’s grid system.  
6. **Form Integration**: Used Formspree endpoint for handling submissions.  
7. **Deployment**: Pushed code to GitHub and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.

## ✅ Challenges & Solutions
- **Carousel captions visibility** → Added text shadows with CSS for better readability.  
- **Contact form backend** → Used Formspree to handle form submissions easily without custom backend.  
- **Maintaining design consistency** → Created a custom CSS file to apply consistent spacing, colors, and effects.

## 🧾 Transparency
I used:
- **Bootstrap Documentation & Examples** → for component structures.  
- **ChatGPT (AI assistance)** → for guidance, polishing code, and writing README.  
- **Formspree** → for functional forms.  
- Manual coding & testing → to implement and style the project.
